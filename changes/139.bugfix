Fix errors raised when `AiohttpSessionRequester` is disconnected while writing a request body.

The server is allowed to disconnect at any time during a request session, which point we want to retry the request.

A disconnection could manifest as an `aiohttp.ServerDisconnectedError` if it happened between requests, or it could be `aiohttp.ClientOSError` if it happened while we are writing the request body. Both errors derive from `aiohttp.ClientConnectionError` for socket errors.

Also use `repr` when encapsulating errors for easier debugging.
