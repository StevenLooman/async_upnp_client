Ignore the ``HOST``-header in ``SsdpListener``. When a device advertises on both IPv4 and IPV6, the advertisements
have the header ``239.255.255.250:1900`` and ``[FF02::C]:1900``, respectively. Given that the ``SsdpListener`` did
not ignore this header up to now, it was seen as a change and causing a reinitialisation in the Home Assistant
``upnp`` component.
